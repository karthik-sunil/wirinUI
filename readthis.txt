In this work, we analyze changes in respiration during
emotional stress induced by a modification of the Trier
Social Stress Test. The following stages in the test were
analyzed: the pre-relaxing stage, the story telling stage,
the anticipation of stress and the video exposition stage.
Respiration signal is recorded during the whole test us-
ing a thoracic band. Power spectral density (PSD) of res-
piration is computed in running windows using a modifi-
cation of Welch periodogram in which sufficiently peaked
spectra are averaged. Then, respiratory frequency (F R ) is
estimated from the “peaked-conditioned” averaged spec-
tra. Results show that respiratory rate is significantly
(p < 0.05 according to the Friedman test) higher, while
a measure of spectral peakness and the percentage of PSD
used to compute (F R ) is lower during stress stages than
during relax. These results suggest that the respiration-
related parameters have potential discrimination power
for stress level assessment
